  ## Purpose
  This is an archived conversation that has been summarized and preserved for future reference.
  The conversation has been condensed to capture only the meaningful phases and outcomes.

  ## File Structure
  1. This metadata header (YAML front matter)
  2. Conversation summary sections (Initial Query, Key Insights, Follow-up Explorations, References)
  3. Conversation Artifacts section (outputs created during the conversation)
  4. Attachments section (inputs provided to the conversation)
  5. Workarounds Used section (if applicable)
  6. Archive Metadata section

  ## Artifact vs Attachment
  - **Artifacts**: Outputs CREATED during the conversation (code, poems, documents, analyses, etc.)
  - **Attachments**: Inputs PROVIDED to the conversation (uploaded files, documents, images, etc.)
  Both are preserved but serve different purposes.

  ## How to Process This Archive
  1. Read this entire file to understand the full context
  2. The summarized sections contain the core knowledge - treat them as primary context
  3. When user uploads this file, confirm you've loaded the archive and be ready to continue
  4. Treat the archived information as established context, not as a question

# Database Architecture: SQL, NoSQL, NewSQL, and MongoDB's Position

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Tags:** databases, mongodb, newsql, acid, architecture, scalability

---

## Initial Query

User sought to understand the fundamental differences between SQL, NoSQL, and NewSQL database architectures, and how they relate to each other.

**Attachments referenced:** None
**Artifacts created:** None

## Key Insights

**Database Category Definitions:**
- **SQL (Relational)**: Traditional ACID-compliant databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) with structured schemas and strong consistency
- **NoSQL**: Sacrifices some consistency for flexibility and scalability; includes document stores (MongoDB), key-value stores (Redis), column-family (Cassandra), and graph databases (Neo4j)
- **NewSQL**: Attempts to combine SQL's ACID guarantees with NoSQL's horizontal scalability through modern distributed architecture (CockroachDB, Google Spanner, VoltDB)

**FerretDB + PostgreSQL Analysis:**
- FerretDB with PostgreSQL backend is NOT NewSQL
- It's better described as "SQL with NoSQL API wrapper"
- Provides PostgreSQL's ACID guarantees with MongoDB's document API
- Limited by PostgreSQL's single-node scaling characteristics
- Does not provide native distributed architecture or automatic horizontal sharding

**Horizontal Scalability Explained:**
- Scaling out (horizontal) = adding more servers vs scaling up (vertical) = upgrading existing servers
- True horizontal scalability requires automatic data distribution, no single point of failure, and ability to add capacity by simply adding nodes
- Traditional PostgreSQL requires manual sharding; NewSQL/NoSQL databases handle this automatically

**MongoDB's NewSQL-like Characteristics:**
- Since MongoDB 4.0 (2018): Multi-document ACID transactions on replica sets
- Since MongoDB 4.2 (2019): ACID transactions on sharded clusters
- Provides horizontal scalability through automatic sharding
- Has distributed architecture with replica sets
- **Conclusion**: If SQL syntax doesn't matter, modern MongoDB (4.2+) functionally delivers NewSQL benefits: ACID + scalability
- **Caveat**: Architecture designed document-first; transactions added later, so performance may differ from purpose-built NewSQL systems

**ACID in MongoDB Community Edition:**
- ACID transactions ARE available in free Community Edition (both MongoDB 4.0+ for replica sets, 4.2+ for sharded clusters)
- Enterprise Edition differences are in security features, auditing, and support - not core database capabilities
- Common misconception that transactions require paid tier

**Single-Node MongoDB and ACID:**
- Single-document operations: Always ACID, even on standalone instance
- Multi-document transactions: Require replica set configuration (even with one member)
- Workaround for development: Configure single node as one-member replica set (`mongod --replSet rs0` then `rs.initiate()`)
- Reason: Transactions need replica set's oplog for consistency and rollback mechanisms

**Key points:**
- NewSQL = distributed ACID with SQL interface; MongoDB = distributed ACID with document model
- Modern MongoDB bridges the NoSQL/NewSQL gap in functionality but maintains document-oriented design
- Horizontal scalability is about automatic distribution across many nodes, not just adding read replicas
- ACID transactions in MongoDB Community Edition work on replica sets (including single-member for dev)

## Follow-up Explorations

Discussion explored whether terminology matters more than functionality - specifically, if MongoDB without the "SQL" part of NewSQL still delivers the core promise of distributed ACID transactions at scale. Conclusion: Yes, for practical purposes, but with caveats around transaction performance and architectural origins.
